But the fun is just beginning!

Here are some resources that you might find helpful as you continue on your journey with Gatsby.

## Learn more

* The official Gatsby Documentation.
    * [**How-To Guides**](/docs/how-to/): Practical step-by-step guides to help you achieve a specific goal. Most useful when you're trying to get something done.
    * [**Reference Guides**](/docs/reference/): Nitty-gritty technical descriptions of how Gatsby works. Most useful when you need detailed information about Gatsby's APIs.
    * [**Conceptual Guides**](/docs/conceptual/): Big-picture explanations of higher-level Gatsby concepts. Most useful for building understanding of a particular topic.

Here are some docs to learn more about specific topics that weren't covered in the Tutorial:

* client-only routes
* gatsby-node.js
* Gatsby functions

## Ask for help

* The Gatsby Discord (Wondering if we should send them to GitHub discussions in addition/instead. Thoughts?)
* Twitter (Do we have any hashtags that we use to track engagement? The old Tutorial listed #BuildWithGatsby, is that still relevant?)
* Gatsby Support page https://www.gatsbyjs.com/support/

## See what the team is working on (news)

* GitHub discussions.
* The Twitch livestreams? Potentially also to the YouTube for past recordings.
